# macro
Our macro package aggregates multiple internal little tools, which we want to try out.
Some tools may have been proofed to be useful, for some we still collect usage reports and others are just here for archive or compatibility purposes.

## FAQ

### How to execute?

Change the working directory to your go module and call the macro expander as follows:

```bash
go run github.com/worldiety/macro/cmd/expand@latest
```

Note, that go caches github aggressively, so ensure that you have the latest version, if new commits have arrived today:

```bash
GOPROXY=direct go run github.com/worldiety/macro/cmd/expand@latest
```

### There are so many error logs
Sorry, but the implementation is not (yet) complete.
However, the result is often still acceptable.
Try to switch to supported basic types and/or introduce distinct named types.

### Where are the unit tests?
They wait to get written by you.



## tagged union
In the following FAQ we document our discussions about the tagged union macro.

### Example

Consider some source code like

```go
// A Component is a sum type or tagged union.
// This is the default notation with adjacent encoding, which supports all types.
//
// #[enum]
type _Component interface {
	Button | TextField | Text | Chapter | xcompo.RichText | xcompo.Icon | string | []string | []Text
}

```

Alternatively, there are the following notation options:
```go
// A Component is a sum type or tagged union.
// Actually, we can generate different flavors, so that Go makes fun for modelling business stuff.
// Note, that this encoding variant only works for structs by definition.
//
// #[go.TaggedUnion "json":"internal", "tag":"type"]
type _Component interface {
	Button | TextField | Text | Chapter | xcompo.RichText | xcompo.Icon | string | []string | []Text
}

```

Note the macro invocation.
Execute the generator as follows to let a `component.gen.go` file be generated aside the file which contains the `_Component` definition:

Take a look at the result at https://github.com/worldiety/macro/blob/main/testdata/example/domain/component.gen.go

### Config options
Currently, encoding `adjacent` (default) or `internal` is possible:

```rust
#[go.TaggedUnion "json":"adjacent", "tag":"type", "names":[]]
```

which is the same as ommitting the options and resorting to the default settings.

Note, that the names attribute may contain a list of alternate serialization names.
This is important for refactoring type names or just supporting names from external systems.
The order and length of the names array must exactly match the union types order.

```rust
#[go.TaggedUnion]
```

There is also a hybrid mode, where the generated enum-box accepts interfaces instead of all these
verbose WithX modifiers.
This only works, if all members of the sum type are defined within the same package, so that we
can generate a package-private marker interface.

Example:
```go
// #[go.TaggedUnion "markerMethod":true]
type _Frucht interface {
	Birne | Kirsche
}

type Birne string
type Kirsche string

func blub() {
	var frucht Frucht
	frucht = NewFrucht(Birne("Helene"))
	_ = frucht

}
```

### Why choice types in Go, there are already interfaces?
A choice type can be expressed in many ways.
For us, the developer ergonomic is the most important argument.
A developer has to express a domain model in a readable and understandable way.
An evolution of the domain and therefore the code, must not result in unwanted side effects, thus we want as much as possible support from the type system.

However, it is currently nearly impossible to express a closed (polymorphic) sum type using interfaces in Go.
See also https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57644 for details.
Probably the most popular approach is to introduce package-private methods and an according marker interface.
However, there are edge cases when embedding such types and this also only works for types in the same package.
There are also situations, where a generic instantiation may be (mis-)used to express sum type facts, but these fall immediately short in polymorphic use cases.

### Why not just a linter?
We have considered this, but this means it must run more or less all the time and there is no IDE support like autocompletion for it.
In contrast to that, once generated, the sum type can be used by any other subdomain or as a supporting domain in a type safe way.
A linter does also not help with serialization.
If interfaces as sum types become a thing in Go, we will reconsider a linter.

### Why not just Rust?
Rust is likely also a good choice, however, it may introduce a lot of unwanted technical burden into a domain model.
The ownership model enforces domain facts which are either undefined or sometimes even not sound from the domain perspective.
By definition, the Rust approach excludes a lot of valid solutions, for the sake of limitations imposed by the programming model.
Therefore, a GC oriented language like Go can also be a good fit, just with another tradeof regarding the type system.

### Why a tagged union, isn't that the same as an interface?
Sort of, however, the generated container has a clear discriminator to distinguish each case.
It is not possible to generally solve a static exhaustive match using the Go interface semantics without introducing further restrictions, see also https://blog.merovius.de/posts/2022-05-16-calculating-type-sets/ for more details.
Therefore, we introduce the restriction of the discriminator or enumerator for our type sets.
We do not care if the types within a tagged union are polymorphic interchangeable, they just need to have a distinct name.

There are a lot of other approaches with different trade offs which we want to try out it in the future.

### Why all these AsX() (x,ok) methods?
First of all, a (non package local) type can be part of different choice types within the same package.
If it is a function, the parameter must be polymorphic to all possible choice types.
So, the only natural criteria to identify this, is a method which tells us exactly that fact.
We prefixed it with 'As' to lower the risk of method set collisions, especially with typical ordinary getters which usually do not impose a tuple return.
It is used exactly in the way, as an ordinary type switch could be used, but statically proofed.
These methods enables also a lot of expressive polymorphic cases, where a receiver can just define its accessor interface and can work with any tagged union which may provide it as an element.


### Why a Switch method?
Due to the limited type system in Go (no useful monads), it is idiomatic to use func closures for causing side effects.
We hope, that an alternate pipeline notation will rise in the future and help in reading nested function calls.

### Why function MatchX?
This introduces another level of type safety, which cannot be statically proofed using side effect closures.
Using this functional approach, a developer can be sure to map each case exhaustively and not forget any case by accident.
Any change will more likely result in a compiler error instead of just accidently processing a zero value.

### Why JSON Marshal/Unmarshal?
Unmarshalling interface types in Go has never been a supported feature and always requires a lot of boilerplate code.
Our implementations capture the most common use cases by default.

## typescript model transpiler
The typescript model transpiler takes sum types and struct definitions and some primitives and translates it from Go code into TypeScript code.
This is quite limited and is only useful if your transpile target will result in the same flat directory.
However, it generates a lot better looking idiomatic code with generic support and documentation than using OpenAPI.

```go
// Property represents the current value of an allocated property which is uniquely addressed through a pointer
// within the backend process.
// Note, that these pointers are not real pointers and only unique and valid for a specific scope.
// #[go.TypeScript "path":"web/vuejs/src/shared/protocol/ora"]
type Property[T any] struct {
    // Ptr is short for "Pointer" and references a property instance within the backend.
    // Because it is so common, the json field name is just p.
    Ptr Ptr `json:"p"`
    // Value contains the actual value specified by the generic type parameter and shortend to v in json.
    Value T `json:"v"`
}
```

This results in the following 'property.ts' file.

```typescript
/**
 * Code generated by github.com/worldiety/macro. DO NOT EDIT.
 */


import type { Ptr } from '@/shared/protocol/ora/ptr';

/**
 * Property represents the current value of an allocated property which is uniquely addressed through a pointer
 * within the backend process.
 * Note, that these pointers are not real pointers and only unique and valid for a specific scope.
 */
export interface Property<T> {

    /**
     * Ptr is short for "Pointer" and references a property instance within the backend.
     * Because it is so common, the json field name is just p.
     */
    p /*Ptr*/: Ptr;

    /**
     * Value contains the actual value specified by the generic type parameter and shortend to v in json.
     */
    v /*Value*/: T;
}
```

## markdown domain-driven documentation generator
You can simply annotate your functions and types with a bunch of macro annotations to enrich your model with more characteristics.
Then you can emit a structured glossary based on your source code comments, so that your documentation is always up-to-date and your customer and project owner is surprised and happy.

See the generated [example](https://github.com/worldiety/macro/blob/main/testdata/example/README.md).

To create the document, start with the markdown root annotation, e.g. at your main function.
Currently, the location does not matter but keep it there for future compatibility.

```go
// #[markdown]
func main() {
	//...
}
```

You can customize the out file, by providing the _out_ and other attributes:

```rust
#[markdown "out":"my-glossary.md", "omitSecurityChapter":false]
```

Then continue by annotating your bounded context packages.
Note, that you can always define an optional human readable alias name for any of defined annotations below.

```go
// Package domain enthält den Bounded Context über die Zeiterfassung.
// #[@BoundedContext "Zeiterfassungsmanagement"]
package domain

//...
```

Inside your bounded context package annotate your domain-driven types.
Types without a bounded context are not documented, thus annotate your shared kernel or supporting context just as a regular bounded context.
Here is an example for documenting a use case.
```go
// Cooles Zeitbuchen ist angesagt.
// #[@Usecase]
func (z *Zeiterfassung) ZeitBuchen(user User, mitarbeiter Mitarbeiter, dauer time.Duration) error {
//...
}
```

The following annotations are available and inspected:
* @Entity
* @Aggregate
* @Value
* @DomainEvent
* @Usecase
* @Repository
* @BoundedContext
* @DomainService
* @Project

## Permission audit linter and generator of use cases

Permissions per use case are and reaching out to a security audit log is tedious, repeating and error prone task.
Therefore, we have created this macro to lint the correct usage of an audit mechanism, keep the static permissions unique per program and emit a table for it.

Start with annotating your use cases and keep the following form:

```go
// #[@Usecase]
// #[go.permission.audit]
func (z *Zeiterfassung) ZeitBuchen(user YourWhateverDomainAuthType, mitarbeiter Mitarbeiter, dauer time.Duration) (int, error) {
	// the first statement must be combined guard-check-call to the audit log 
	// the permission ID is hand-coded by you 
	if err := user.Audit("de.worldiety.mitarbeiter"); err != nil {
		// the last statement in the guard-check must be a return 
		return 0, err
    } 
	
	// actual use case logic 
	//...
}
```

To emit the complete table of all permissions, annotate the package, where you want to define your permission type and factory:

```go
// #[go.permission.generateTable]
package supporting

//...
```

See the generated [permission example](https://github.com/worldiety/macro/blob/main/testdata/example/supporting/macros.gen.go).
